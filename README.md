# Power-Bi-Challenges
Some challenges found on the internet, I am making available for you to check my work, contact via LinkedIn.

In these challenges, various user needs were verified and in different approaches for a better decision by the manager.

Each challenge will have the link provided of who produced the test. Some approaches I used the design I thought more appropriate than my own, all formulas were my own.
Resolution used: 1440 x 900.
Reason for not using 1080p, my monitor has the resolution above.
When I change the existing monitor, the next designs will be in 1080p or higher resolution.
